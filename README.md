# hello-world
Meh

My name is John Crichton
[I'm lost]
An astronaut
[Shot through a wormhole]
In some distant part of the Universe
[I'm trying to stay alive]
Aboard this ship
[This living ship]
Of escaped prisoners
[My friends]
If you can here me
[Beware]
If I make it back
[Will they follow?]
If I open the door
[Are you ready?]
Earth is unprepared
[Helpless]
For the nightmares
[I've seen]
Or should I stay
[Protect my home]
Not show them
[You exist]
But then you'll never know
[The wonders I've seen]
